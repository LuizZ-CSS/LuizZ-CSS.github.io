Welcome to my personal website :blush: My name is Yufei Zhu, or you may refer me as "Louise". I am thrilled to introduce myself as an aspiring Master's graduate in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a passion for harnessing the power of technology to delve into the fascinating realm of computational social science. 

In my future academic journey, I would like to bridge the gap between engineering methodologies and social sciences, aiming to unravel novel insights and explanations to complex societal phenomena.
